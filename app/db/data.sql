MediaWiki is the world''s most popular wiki platform, the software that runs Wikipedia and thousands of other websites. Though it appears simple to use at first glance, MediaWiki has extraordinarily powerful and deep capabilities for managing and organizing knowledge. In corporate environments, MediaWiki can transform the way teams write and collaborate. This comprehensive book covers MediaWiki''s rich (and sometimes subtle) features, helping you become a wiki expert in no time.You''ll learn how to: find your way around by effective searching and browsing; create and edit articles, categories, and user preferences; use advanced features for authors, such as templates, dynamic lists, logical parser functions, and RSS, to organize and maintain large numbers of articles; install and run your own wiki, and configure its look and behavior; and, develop custom wiki features, called extensions, with the PHP programming language and MySQL database.
This book also provides special guidance for creating successful corporate wikis. For beginners who want to create or work on collaborative, community-driven websites with this platform, "MediaWiki" is the essential one-stop guide.

Many old Java idioms are no longer required and new features like lambda expressions will increase programmer productivity, but navigating these changes can be challenging.



Core Java (R) for the Impatient is a complete but concise guide to Java SE 8. Written by Cay Horstmann-the author of Java SE 8 for the Really Impatient and Core Java (TM), the classic, two-volume introduction to the Java language-this indispensable new tutorial offers a faster, easier pathway for learning the language and libraries. Given the size of the language and the scope of the new features introduced in Java SE 8, there''s plenty of material to cover, but it''s presented in small chunks organized for quick access and easy understanding.



If you''re an experienced programmer, Horstmann''s practical insights and sample code will help you quickly take advantage of lambda expressions (closures), streams, and other Java language and platform improvements. Horstmann covers everything developers need to know about modern Java, including



Crisp and effective coverage of lambda expressions, enabling you to express actions with a concise syntax
A thorough introduction to the new streams API, which makes working with data far more flexible and efficient
A treatment of concurrent programming that encourages you to design your programs in terms of cooperating tasks instead of low-level threads and locks
Up-to-date coverage of new libraries like Date and Time

Scala embraces the functional programming style without abandoning the object-oriented paradigm, and it allows you to write programs more concisely than in Java. Because Scala runs on the JVM, it can access any Java library and is interoperable with familiar Java frameworks. Scala also makes it easier to leverage the full power of concurrency.




Written for experienced Java, C++, or C# programmers who are new to Scala or functional programming, Scala for the Impatient, Second Edition, introduces the key Scala concepts and techniques you need in order to be productive quickly. It is the perfect introduction to the language, particularly for impatient readers who want to learn the fundamentals of Scala so they can start coding quickly. It doesn''t attempt to exhaustively list all the features of the language or make you suffer through long and contrived examples. Instead, carefully crafted examples and hands-on activities guide you through well-defined stages of competency, from basic to expert.




This revised edition has been thoroughly updated for Scala 2.12 and reflects current Scala usage. It includes added coverage of recent Scala features, including string interpolation, dynamic invocation, implicit classes, and futures. Scala is a big language, but you can use it effectively without knowing all of its details intimately. This title provides precisely the information that you need to get started in compact, easy-to-understand chunks.



Get started quickly with Scala''s interpreter, syntax, tools, and unique idioms
Master core language features: functions, arrays, maps, tuples, packages, imports, exception handling, and more
Become familiar with object-oriented programming in Scala: classes, inheritance, and traits
Use Scala for real-world programming tasks: working with files, regular expressions, and XML
Work with higher-order functions and the powerful Scala collections library
Leverage Scala''s powerful pattern matching and case classes
Create concurrent programs with Scala futures
Implement domain-specific languages
Understand the Scala type system
Apply advanced "power tools," such as annotations, implicits, and type classes

This is something all teachers want and all students deserve. In Creating Cultures of Thinking: The 8 Forces We Must Master to Truly Transform Our Schools, Ron Ritchhart, author of Making Thinking Visible, explains how creating a culture of thinking is more important to learning than any particular curriculum and he outlines how any school or teacher can accomplish this by leveraging 8 cultural forces: expectations, language, time, modeling, opportunities, routines, interactions, and environment. With the techniques and rich classroom vignettes throughout this book, Ritchhart shows that creating a culture of thinking is not about just adhering to a particular set of practices or a general expectation that people should be involved in thinking.
A culture of thinking produces the feelings, energy, and even joy that can propel learning forward and motivate us to do what at times can be hard and challenging mental work.',4,6,4);

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that''s more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language.
In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: * Syntax * Objects * Functions * Inheritance * Arrays * Regular expressions * Methods * Style * Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you''ll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.
