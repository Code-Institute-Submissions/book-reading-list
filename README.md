# Book Reading Lists
The project is aimed for users that like to read books and make reading lists of books that they wish to read or have read or any other custom reading list.  
The website is build using Flask backend frameworks and Bootstrap front end with a relational database for storing the data and python for processing data.
[Hosted on Heroku](https://book-reading-lists.herokuapp.com/index)
## UX
 The user that is visiting the page can browse the list of all books that are stored in the database. In order to create or add any new data, the user must be registered. This allows users to create individual reading lists and add new books to a database that are not there yet.
#### User Stories
* As a user can, I can browse all the books on the website so I can see all of them without registering an account.
* As a user, I can sort books by an author so I can see all the books form this author.
* As a user, I can sort books by a category so I can see all the books form this category.
* As a user, I can sort books by a publisher so I can see all the books form this publisher.

* As a registered user, I can create reading lists so I can add books I want to the list.
